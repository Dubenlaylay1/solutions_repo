### Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

### Motivation

Calculating equivalent resistance is a fundamental problem in electrical circuits, essential for understanding and designing efficient systems. While traditional methods involve iteratively applying series and parallel resistor rules, these approaches can become cumbersome for complex circuits with many components. Graph theory offers a powerful alternative, providing a structured and algorithmic way to analyze circuits.

By representing a circuit as a graph—where nodes correspond to junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to their resistance values—we can systematically simplify even the most intricate networks. This method not only streamlines calculations but also opens the door to automated analysis, making it particularly useful in modern applications like circuit simulation software, optimization problems, and network design.

Studying equivalent resistance through graph theory is valuable not only for its practical applications but also for the deeper insights it provides into the interplay between electrical and mathematical concepts. This approach highlights the versatility of graph theory, demonstrating its relevance across physics, engineering, and computer science.

# Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory — Detailed Algorithm Description

### Introduction and Motivation

Calculating the equivalent resistance of a circuit is a foundational problem in electrical engineering, as it helps us understand how current flows through complex networks of resistors. Traditional approaches use straightforward series and parallel formulas, but as circuits grow more complex — with combinations of series and parallel resistors arranged in nested structures, loops, and bridges — manual calculation becomes unwieldy or even impossible without systematic methods.

Graph theory offers a natural and powerful framework to tackle this. By modeling a circuit as a graph:

- **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent electrical junctions or connection points.
- **Edges:** Represent resistors, with weights corresponding to their resistance values.

This abstraction lets us leverage graph algorithms to identify patterns — such as series and parallel structures — and simplify the circuit iteratively, making complex networks tractable and enabling algorithmic and automated analysis.

### Fundamental Concepts in Circuit-Graph Mapping

- **Series Connection in Graph Terms:**  
  A node with exactly two incident edges (degree 2), except for the circuit’s start and end nodes, can be "removed" by merging those two edges into one with summed resistance. This corresponds to the physical concept of resistors connected end-to-end.

- **Parallel Connection in Graph Terms:**  
  Multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes represent resistors in parallel. These edges can be replaced by a single equivalent edge whose resistance is given by the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals formula.

- **Complex Structures (Nested Series-Parallel and Cycles):**  
  Complex circuits often contain nested combinations of series and parallel parts, sometimes forming loops or bridges. The iterative reduction approach handles this by repeatedly simplifying series and parallel elements, which may open new simplification opportunities as the graph changes.

### Algorithm Overview

The algorithm works by **iterative graph reduction**:

1. **Identify series components** (nodes with degree 2 excluding terminals) and reduce them by merging their edges.
2. **Identify parallel components** (multiple edges between two nodes) and reduce them by calculating equivalent resistance.
3. Repeat these steps until the graph is simplified to a single edge between the source and sink nodes.

This process is guaranteed to converge for circuits composed purely of resistors, as each step strictly reduces the number of edges or nodes in the graph.
